# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It contains a sample contract, a test for that contract, a Hello world contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Contract deployed to address: 0xf0675977d38D9E87ca02934F356D8EaecD609D2A
